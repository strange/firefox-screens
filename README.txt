An extremely simple Firefox addon that facilitates capturing of web pages as
images.

With screens you can:

* Set save location (defaults to the download folder)
* Take full size screenshots of web sites that are stored in your prefered
  location with a unique but descriptive filename (either by right-clicking on
  the page or pressing CMD-SHIFT-D).

Installation
============

Simply drag the latest version of the addon from `releases/` onto a running
instance of Firefox.

Building
========

Change to the `screens/` directory and run::

    ./build.sh

Disclaimer
==========

This is old and untested. I wrote it in a hurry and there are a million things
I could have done better. Use at your own risk! :)
